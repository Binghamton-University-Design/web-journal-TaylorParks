						<p>Books are an archival system that holds knowledge from all over the world as well as from different points in time.  No matter the spoken language, words on a page represent a physical representation for frequencies.  There are different ways to represent these frequencies, such as through sheet music as well as abstractly through waveforms.  However, these wave forms can be personalized because everyoneâ€™s voice is different and even through different inflections.</p>

						<p>This plaque is an abstract representation of emotions, literature, as well as music that I believe represents who I am as an artist as well as a person.  Using a method that everyone experiences universally and transforming it into a visual representation.  By adding an archival system that was made to hold languages that aren't universal, but instead representing that language in a universal way, it shows that we aren't as different as it may seem. No matter if you are across the planet or across the universe.</p>
